# FE-SSL Labs

A front-end application for SSL labs

## Getting Started

The program is based on the output (Json files) generated by the sslscan scripts of qualys labs (ssllabs-scan)
the basics are quite simple:



### Prerequisites & Installing

```
1 Create a directory (inside the $HOMEDIR/scans directory) with as name the FQDN for each site that you want to test.
2 The scan.sh will populate these directories with a json file and create a symbolic link for the latest scan, this link (name) will be used by our front end applcation in order to retreive the right arrays.
3 change the 2 variables ($PROXYIP & $PROXYPORT inside the scan.sh file with your own proxy settings.
4 this scan.sh script can be launched once a week or once a day depending on your personal needs with crontab for instance.
5 from that moment on, the only thing that you need is that your webserver has access to the $HOMEDIR/scans directory
```

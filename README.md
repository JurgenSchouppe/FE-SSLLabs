The program is based on the outbut (Json files) generated by the sslscan scripts of qualys labs (ssllabs-scan)

The basics are quite simple:

1 : Create a directory (inside the $HOMEDIR/scans directory) with as name the FQDN for each site that you want to test.<br>
2 : The scan.sh will populate these directories with a json file and create a symbolic link for the latest scan, this link (name) will be used by our front end applcation in order to retreive the right arrays.<br>
3 : change the 2 variables ($PROXYIP & $PROXYPORT inside the scan.sh file with your own proxy settings.<br>
4 : this scan.sh script can be launched once a week or once a day depending on your personal needs with crontab for instance.<br>
5 : from that moment on, the only thing that you need is that your webserver has access to the $HOMEDIR/scans directory <br>

.....This is work in progress and there are still many things to do......<br>
